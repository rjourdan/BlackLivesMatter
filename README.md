# Black Lives Matter

Here is my modest contribution to the "Black Lives Matter" movement. Here is a list of documents/videos/links for someone to get educated on Diversity, Torelance and understand that Black Lives really Matter. As a parent, I feel that my responsibility to educate my kids on the matter so they can help us build a better world.
